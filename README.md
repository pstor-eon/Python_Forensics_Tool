# Python_Forensics_Tool
This repository contains a collection of Python-based forensic tools for analyzing and converting data. The tools are organized into separate folders according to their functionality.

### Folder Structure

```

### Tools
**ASCII**
The ascii.py script allows you to convert ASCII-encoded data into a readable string format. For more information, check the ASCII folder's README.md.

**Data Size Converter**
The DataSizeConverter.py script helps you convert data sizes between different units, such as bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, etc. For more information, check the Data folder's README.md.

**Hex**
The hex.py scriptShows how to work with strings and ASCII codes in Python, and how to use the functions chr(), ord() and hex() to convert between strings and ASCII codes. For more information, check the hex folder's README.md.

### Environment Setup
Before using the Python Forensics Tool, make sure you have the proper environment set up. Follow the steps below to prepare your environment.

**Requirements**
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pip (Python Package Installer)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pstor-eon/Python_Forensics_Tool.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Python_Forensics_Tool
```
3. Install the required packages:

**(Optional)** It is recommended to create a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other projects. You can use venv (Python's built-in virtual environment module) or any other virtual environment tool of your choice. To create a virtual environment using venv, run:
```bash
python3 -m venv (virtual environment name)
```

**(Optional)** Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
```
or
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
- On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
Now, your environment is ready to use the Python Forensics Tool. To deactivate the virtual environment after use, simply type deactivate in your terminal.
